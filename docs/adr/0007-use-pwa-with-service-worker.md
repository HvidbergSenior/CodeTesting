# 7. Use PWA with service worker

Date: 2022-05-02

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application is required to function offline and provide good service on different platforms and devices.

## Decision

The react application should be created using pwa-template for react as described [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app/)

## Consequences

The application will support offline usage and will allow using single codebase while providing near-native experience.
