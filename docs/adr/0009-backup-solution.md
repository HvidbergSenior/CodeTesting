# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2022-05-24

## Status

Proposed

## Context

A backup strategy is needed that will meet the requirements of the contract. The concrete solution should also be manageable by Mj√∏lner.

The exact solution does not need to be decided now, but we need to have a solution in place that will meet the requirements.

## Decision

Backup persistent data in Azure is needed. The resources in question are `Postgres` database(s) as well as files in `blob storage`.

`Azure Database for PostgreSQL` includes automatic backup with a retention period of up to 35 days. The target for restore of automatic backup of data is limited to Azure.

We propose to use `Azure Backup Center` as central backup mechanism. It is possible to perform backup of a Postgres database with long term retention [Postgres backup with long term retention](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-database-postgresql). Offline backup is also possible [Azure Backup offline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-backup-import-export).

## Consequences

Backup solution as-code.

Option of having offline backup.
